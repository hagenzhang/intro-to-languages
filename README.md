# intro-to-languages

This repo represents my journeys through learning various different languages.

It also represents an acknowledgement of a very severe problem I have: getting ahead of myself.
I have a tendancy to start very ambitious projects, end up getting confused and lost, and then struggle to finish them in a timely manner. 

The goal of this repo is to encourage me to work my way up to bigger projects, and to learn how to slow down a bit.

## Overview

This repo currently contains projects in the following languages:
 - ARM Assembly
 - C
 - Python

Every single language will be divided into their own independent branch.

Each project will contain a mini readme detailing why I did it, as well as what I learned from it.
