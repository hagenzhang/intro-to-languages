# reading-user-input

Completed: 03/17/2025

A simple project to take in user input and then print it in the console.

One of my "checkpoints" for learning C is to make my own terminal with
custom commands. In order to achieve that, I first need to learn how to
do basic read/write in the terminal.

## Takeaways

- What #include guards / header guards are in C
- What a "size_t" variable is
- How to allocate / reallocate / free memory
- C stdin read
- C header files
