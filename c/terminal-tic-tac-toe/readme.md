# tic-tac-toe

Completed: 03/26/2025

A simple terminal based tic-tac-toe game.

This project just serves as a way for me to get more practice with basic C functionality. Building something like this helps deepen my familiarity with the language. 

One thing that I thought about exploring after this project is creating a project with
CMake, and learning how Makefiles work.

### Takeaways

- scanf functionality
- handling 2D arrays in C
- C ternary operator syntax
