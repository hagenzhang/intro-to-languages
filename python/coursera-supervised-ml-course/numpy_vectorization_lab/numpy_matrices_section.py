"""
Matrices, are two dimensional arrays. The elements of a matrix are all of the same type.
In notation, matrices are denoted with capitol, bold letter such as ùêó.
In this and other labs, m is often the number of rows and n the number of columns.
The elements of a matrix can be referenced with a two dimensional index. In math settings,
numbers in the index typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing
will run from 0 to n-1.

NumPy's basic data structure is an indexable, n-dimensional array containing elements of the same type (dtype). 
Matrices have a two-dimensional (2-D) index [m,n].

# access an element
print(f"\na[2,0].shape: {a[2, 0].shape}, a[2,0] = {a[2, 0]},     type(a[2,0]) = {type(a[2, 0])} Accessing an element returns a scalar")

# It is worth drawing attention to the last example. Accessing a matrix by just specifying the row will return a 1-D vector!

"""
A note on "reshape"
The previous example used reshape to shape the array.
a = np.arange(6).reshape(-1, 2)

This line of code first created a 1-D Vector of six elements. 
It then reshaped that vector into a 2-D array using the reshape command. 
This could have been written:

a = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)

To arrive at the same 3 row, 2 column array. The -1 argument tells the routine 
to compute the number of rows given the size of the array and the number of columns.
